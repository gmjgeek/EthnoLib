### [Find-Language](components/language-chooser/common/find-language/README.md)

## Development

Ethnolib is a [monorepo using nx](https://nx.dev/concepts/decisions/why-monorepos), with npm for package management.

We recommend installing nx globally.
`npm i -g nx`. If you prefer not to, you can simply prefix all commands with with `npx` instead.

Nx caches builds for efficiency. To clear the local cache, run `nx reset`.

Use nx to build or run a hot-reload development server for a package if relevant. For example, to build or run the MUI language chooser demo:

```
nx build @ethnolib/language-chooser-react-mui
```

or

```
nx dev @ethnolib/language-chooser-react-mui
```

## Testing

Vitest is used for writing unit tests.  From the top level folder, all of the unit tests can be run with these commands:

```
npm run test
```

or

```
npm run testonce
```

The first command runs the tests continually in *watch* mode with minimal output while tests are passing successfully.  The second command runs all the tests just once and quits after printing a summary of test results to the console window.

### Dependency Versions

We are currently having all packages manage their own dependencies in their package level `package.json` files, but keeping them all on the same versions of commonly used packages for compatibility. Current versions:

    "react": "^17.0.2",
    "@mui/material": "^5.15.19",
    "@emotion/react": "^11.11.4",
